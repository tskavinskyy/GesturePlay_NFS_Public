# Need For Speed Gesture Play Controler

### Demonstration on how to play https://youtu.be/u-FXfJzHhFQ?si=F-rfytD372bzSmHH

#### start the game. Pressing ALT+ENTER allows you to make most games display in a window.
#### I like putting the game on full screen in windown and code on the right half of the screen
#### Pressing ALT TAB allows you to switch between windows. 
#### While the game is running run the code. A window will apear. it will also click on the right side of the screen hopefully selecting game
#### to exit switch to the window produced by code and press x
#### I would suggest sitting 3-4 feet from the camera 

### Game controls
#### There are two horisontal lines on the screen. 
#### If both your hands are inbetween the lines nothing happens
#### If your hsnds are above the top line the car will go forward. 
#### If your hands are below the bottom line your pc will press back button to slow down and eventualy reverse. 
#### To turn the wheel pretend that you are holding the wheel and turn. The code reads the angle between you hands. its displayed on the screen. if the number is small you will go straight if the angle increases the car will turn right. If the angle goes negative the car will turn left.
